    Supplemental Guidance:
    Contingency training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned
roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure that the
appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For
example, regular users may only need to know when and where to report for duty
during contingency operations and if normal duties are affected; system
administrators may require additional training on how to set up information
systems at alternate processing and storage sites; and managers/senior leaders
may receive more specific training on how to conduct mission-essential
functions in designated off-site locations and how to establish communications
with other governmental entities for purposes of coordination on
contingency-related activities. Training for contingency roles/responsibilities
reflects the specific continuity requirements in the contingency plan.Managers
responsible for contingency operations and technical personnel should meet, at
a minimum, once a year for review of contingency policies and procedures. Each
review session should be documented and confirm that appropriate training has
been completed.
