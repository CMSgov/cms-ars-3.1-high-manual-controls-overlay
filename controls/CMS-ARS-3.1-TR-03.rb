    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Making information about an organization's privacy program
readily available to the public reduces the burden on individuals wanting to
better understand an organization's privacy practices; and reduces
burden on privacy offices and program officials by providing answers to common
privacy questions through an easily accessible forum.Organizations employ
different mechanisms for informing the public about their privacy practices
including, but not limited to, privacy impact assessments (PIA), system of
records notices (SORN), privacy reports, publicly available web pages, email
distributions, blogs, and periodic publications (e.g., quarterly newsletters).
Organizations also employ publicly facing email addresses and/or phone lines
that enable the public to provide feedback and/or direct questions to privacy
offices regarding privacy practices.
