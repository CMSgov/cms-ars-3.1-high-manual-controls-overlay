    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Organizational sanctions processes reflect applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
Sanctions processes are described in access agreements and can be included as
part of general personnel policies and procedures for organizations.
Organizations consult with the Office of General Counsel regarding matters of
employee sanctions.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    If the personnel sanctions are associated with the loss, theft, or
compromise of personally identifiable information (PII), additional care must
be taken to prevent further privacy incidents. When providing notice of
sanctions, do not provide the PII involved in the incident to anyone without an
explicit need to know. Unless the individual needs the specific PII elements
breached to perform their job function, the individual does not need to know
the PII. Instead, provide characterization of the type(s) of PII breached
(e.g., provide 'Full Name' instead of providing
'John Doe,' or 'Blood Type' instead
of 'A positive').
