design documentation; information system configuration settings and associated
documentation, information system audit records; audit tools; and other

  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Implementation Standards:
    High:

    Std.1 - Cryptographic mechanisms shall be employed to protect the integrity
of audit information (e.g. log, and audit tools).

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Audit information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit
settings, and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
activity. This control focuses on technical protection of audit information.
Physical protection of audit information is addressed by media protection
controls and physical and environmental protection controls.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    When audit information contains sensitive information, such as personally
identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI), it must
be protected commensurate with the information's confidentiality
impact level. Audit information could be necessary to enforce criminal or civil
penalties under the Privacy Act. Protecting audit records from compromise by
applying this control enhancement helps ensure their availability when needed.
