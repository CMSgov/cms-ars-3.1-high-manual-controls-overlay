    Implementation Standards:
    High, Moderate & Low:

    Std.1 - The organization forwards information system security and privacy
incident and breach information: - In accordance with reporting requirements
defined under the current RMH, Chapter 08: Incident Response or applicable
incident response plans, whichever is sooner; and - Provides incident and
breach information in format compliant with CMS and Federal (e.g., Continuous
Diagnostics and Mitigation) requirements.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Documenting information system security incidents includes, for example,
maintaining records about each incident, the status of the incident, and other
pertinent information necessary for forensics, evaluating incident details,
trends, and handling. Incident information can be obtained from a variety of
sources, including, for example, incident reports, incident response teams,
audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, and
user/administrator reports.Tracking and documenting security and privacy
incidents enables the organization to respond more effectively and evaluate
both individual incidents and trends across incidents over time.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Tracking and documenting security and privacy incidents enables the
organization to respond more effectively and evaluate both individual incidents
and trends across incidents over time.
