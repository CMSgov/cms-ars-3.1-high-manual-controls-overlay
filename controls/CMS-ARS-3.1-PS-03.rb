    Implementation Standards:
    High, Moderate & Low:

    Std.1 - Require that individuals with significant security responsibilities
be assigned and hold, at a minimum, a Tier 2S background investigation as
defined in the HHS Personnel Security/Suitability Handbook. Assign other
individuals with Public Trust positions the appropriate sensitivity level as
defined in the HHS Personnel Security/Suitability Handbook.

    Systems defined as CSPs:

    High, Moderate & Low:

    CSP.1 - The organization rescreens individuals per the following: (a) For
national security clearances; a reinvestigation is required during the fifth
year for top secret security clearance, the tenth year for secret security
clearance, and fifteenth year for confidential security clearance; and  (b) For
moderate risk law enforcement and high impact public trust level, a
reinvestigation is required during the fifth year. There is no reinvestigation
for other moderate risk positions or any low risk positions.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Personnel screening and rescreening activities reflect applicable federal
laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, guidance,
and specific criteria established for the risk designations of assigned
positions. Organizations may define different rescreening conditions and
frequencies for personnel accessing information systems based on types of
information processed, stored, or transmitted by the systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Screening individuals who are provided access to sensitive information,
such as PII, and re-screening as deemed appropriate by CMS or the organization,
reduces risk.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation
specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at
45 C.F.R. ยง 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d)
(Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the
organization.
