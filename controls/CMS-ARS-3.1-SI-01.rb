    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
in the SI family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the
need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be
included as part of the general information security policy for organizations
or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex
nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the
security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The
organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy
and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Policies that support protecting the integrity of systems and information
are necessary to meet the Privacy Act requirements to protect against any
anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of records.
