    Supplemental Guidance:
    Users posing a significant risk to organizations include individuals for
whom reliable evidence or intelligence indicates either the intention to use
authorized access to information systems to cause harm or through whom
adversaries will cause harm. Harm includes potential adverse impacts to
organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, or the
Nation. Close coordination between AOs, information system administrators, and
HR managers is essential for timely execution of this control enhancement.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Disabling accounts for high-risk individuals is a minimum requirement for
the organization's rules of behavior because of abusing access
privileges to sensitive information, including information protected under the
Privacy Act of 1974.
