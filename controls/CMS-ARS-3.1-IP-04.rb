    Supplemental Guidance:
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Establishing a complaint management process ensures complaints are
addressed in a timely manner and provides an avenue for individuals to
participate in government activities that may impact privacy. Information
received from complaints provides external input regarding organizational
privacy and security practices which may improve processes and systems involved
in collection, use, and maintenance of personally identifiable information
(PII).Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a
valuable source of external input that ultimately improves operational models,
uses of technology, data collection practices, and privacy and security
safeguards. Organizations provide complaint mechanisms that are readily
accessible by the public, include all information necessary for successfully
filing complaints (including contact information for the Senior Official for
Privacy (SOP) or other official designated to receive complaints), and are easy
to use. Organizational complaint management processes include tracking
mechanisms to ensure that all complaints received are reviewed and
appropriately addressed in a timely manner.
