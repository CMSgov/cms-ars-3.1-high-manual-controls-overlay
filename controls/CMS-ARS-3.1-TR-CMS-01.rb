    High & Moderate:

    Std.1 - For any system that does not process or store PII and/or PHI, the
SSP must document this control family as 'Limited Applicability -
System does not process PII nor PHI.'

    Supplemental Guidance:
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
in the TR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws,
Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance.
Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level
may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The
policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy
policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies
reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be
established for the security program in general and for information systems, if
needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in
establishing policy and procedures.
