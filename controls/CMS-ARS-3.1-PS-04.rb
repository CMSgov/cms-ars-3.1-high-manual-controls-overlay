    Implementation Standards:
    High & Moderate:

    Std.1 - System access must be revoked prior to or during the employee
termination process/action.Std.2 - All access and privileges to systems,
networks, and facilities are suspended when employees or contractors
temporarily separate from the organization (e.g., leave of absence).

    Low:

    Std.1 - System access must be revoked during the employee termination
process/action.Std.2 - All access and privileges to systems, networks, and
facilities are suspended when employees or contractors temporarily separate
from the organization (e.g., leave of absence).

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware
authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys,
identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that
terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being
former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information
system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can
include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure
agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may
not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related
to job abandonment, illnesses, and non-availability of supervisors. Exit
interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely
execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for
cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the information
system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the
individuals being notified.Appropriate personnel have access to official
records created by terminated employees that are stored on information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    This control governs termination procedures for access to sensitive
information, such as personally identifiable information (PII).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation
specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at
45 C.F.R. ยง 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d)
(Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the
organization.
