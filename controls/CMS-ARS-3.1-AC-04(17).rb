  title 'Non-Mandatory: Domain Authentication '
  desc  "Control:
    The information system uniquely identifies and authenticates source and
destination points by organization, system, application, and/or individual for
information transfer.
  "
  desc  'check', "
    Assessment Objective:
    Determine if the organization has implemented all elements of this control
as described in the control statements and implementation standard(s).

    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Determine if the information system uniquely identifies and authenticates
source and destination points.

    Assessment Methods and Objects:
    Examine: Access control policy; system security plan; information system
configuration settings and associated documentation; information system
connection or processing agreements; account management documents; and other
relevant documents or records.Examine: Information system implements unique
identification and authentication functionality, based on organization, system,
application, and/or individual, for all source and destination points during
information transfer. Interview: Administration personnel's
knowledge of information flow and interconnection processes and procedures.
Confirm that designated personnel maintain a list of authorized source and
destination points. Test: Automated mechanisms implementing information flow
enforcement policy and mechanisms. Source and destination are verified before
data transmission occurs. Test a sample of automated mechanisms to confirm that
information flow enforcement is properly implemented using uniquely identified
and authenticated source and destination points are the basis for flow control
decisions. Test methods may include:  1. Attempt to send information to /from
unauthenticated source and destination points (systems or users);  2. Verify
that the information system detects the impermissible flow, prevents it, audits
the violation and notifies the appropriate personnel. Examine: Access control

    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations.
The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing
in information systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when
required, and encourages policy compliance by attributing policy violations to
specific organizations/individuals. Successful domain authentication requires
that information system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and
individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating
information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    The ability to identify source and destination points for PII flow within
information systems is necessary for attribution and compliance with need to
know requirements. Implement a higher level of granularity for identification
and authentication based on sensitivity of the PII. This is not to determine
permissibility of the transfer but to enable an audit capability.
