    Supplemental Guidance:
    The plan of action and milestones is a key document in the information
security program and is subject to federal reporting requirements established
by OMB. With the increasing emphasis on organization-wide risk management
across all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization,
mission/business process, and information system), organizations view plans of
action and milestones from an organizational perspective, prioritizing risk
response actions and ensuring consistency with the goals and objectives of the
organization. Plan of action and milestones updates are based on findings from
security control assessments and continuous monitoring activities. OMB FISMA
reporting guidance contains instructions regarding organizational plans of
action and milestones.
