    Implementation Standards:
    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    PHI.1 - The RMH provides implementation standards for cross-organizational
auditing.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    When organizations use information systems and/or services of external
organizations, the auditing capability necessitates a coordinated approach
across organizations. For example, maintaining the identity of individuals that
requested services across organizational boundaries may often be very
difficult, and doing so may prove to have significant performance
ramifications. Therefore, it is often the case that cross-organizational
auditing (e.g., the type of auditing capability provided by service-oriented
architectures) simply captures the identity of individuals issuing requests at
the initial information system, and subsequent systems record that the requests
emanated from authorized individuals.
