modified during preparation for transmission or during reception including, for
example, during aggregation, at protocol transformation points, and during
packing/unpacking. These unauthorized disclosures or modifications compromise
the confidentiality or integrity of the information.

the integrity of information in transit must be assured at all points during
aggregation, packaging and transformation.
