    Supplemental Guidance:
    Because of the distributed nature of the audit information,
cross-organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective
analysis of the auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one
organization may not provide sufficient information to determine the
appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by
individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home
organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such
determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among
organizations.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Since an audit log may contain PHI, when audit information is shared
between organizations, an agreement addressing the handling, protection, and
disclosure of PHI is required.MOUs, memoranda of agreement (MOAs), and other
data sharing agreements must address protection of PHI, audit content
confidentiality ensuring authorized disclosures, and assurance that sharing
agreement define which audit events and results are both captured and shared.
