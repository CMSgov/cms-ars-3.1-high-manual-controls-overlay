    Supplemental Guidance:
    Implementing role-based access controls for physical access provides a
further level of granularity in governing who can access facilities, and even
certain parts of facilities, that store and process sensitive information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The authorization of physical access to the facility should include
considerations of whether the person needs access to PHI and whether such
access is permitted under the HIPAA Security Rule.
