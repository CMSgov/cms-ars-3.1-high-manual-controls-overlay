privacy safeguards and privacy documentation requirements, such as privacy
impact assessments (PIA) and systems of records notices (SORN) when applicable,
have been appropriately addressed prior to any security authorization.

    Implementation Standards:
    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    PHI.1 - The organization's security authorization process must
ensure privacy safeguards and privacy documentation requirements have been
appropriately addressed prior to any security authorization.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Security authorization processes for information systems and environments
of operation require the implementation of an organization-wide risk management
process, a Risk Management Framework, and associated security standards and
guidelines. Specific roles within the risk management process include an
organizational risk executive (function) and designated authorizing officials
for each organizational information system and common control provider.
Security authorization processes are integrated with organizational continuous
monitoring processes to facilitate ongoing understanding and acceptance of risk
to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and
the Nation.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    The security authorization process provides a means for evaluating whether
a system/process has met given privacy safeguards and documentation
requirements.
