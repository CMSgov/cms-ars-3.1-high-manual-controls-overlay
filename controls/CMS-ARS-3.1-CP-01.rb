    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the
effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements
in the Contingency Planning (CP) family. Policy and procedures reflect
applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies,
standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the
organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and
procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general
information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented
by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations.
The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for
information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is
a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Contingency planning policy and procedures must take privacy-applicable
requirements into account so that executing contingency measures does not
result in avoidable privacy incidents and breaches.
