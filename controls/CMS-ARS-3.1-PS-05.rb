    Implementation Standards:
    Systems defined as CSPs:

    High, Moderate & Low:

    CSP.1 - For CSPs, the organization reviews logical and physical access
authorizations to information systems/facilities when personnel are reassigned
or transferred to other positions within the organization and initiates
organization-defined transfer or reassignment actions within five (5) days
following the formal transfer action. CSP.2 - For CSPs, the organization
defines transfer or reassignment actions. Transfer or reassignment actions are
approved and accepted by the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).

    Supplemental Guidance:
    This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are
permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted.
Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or
transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for
personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations
include, for example: (i) Returning old and issuing new keys, identification
cards, and building passes; (ii) Closing information system accounts and
establishing new accounts; (iii) Changing information system access
authorizations (i.e., privileges); and (iv) Providing for access to official
records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in
previous information system accounts.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    When personnel are reassigned or transferred, their access to sensitive
information, such as PII, must be reviewed to determine whether and how their
access permissions should change.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation
specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at
45 C.F.R. ยง 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d)
(Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the
organization.
