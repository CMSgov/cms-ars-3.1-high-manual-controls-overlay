    Supplemental Guidance:
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Validating PII that is used to determine a right, benefit, or privilege for
an individual ensures the determination is based on accurate, timely, and
relevant information. Procedures for validating PII should be commensurate with
the impact to an individual's rights, benefits, or privileges as
determined by the system owner in consultation with the
organization's privacy office.When PII is of a sufficiently
sensitive nature (such as, but not limited to, when it is used for annual
reconfirmation of a taxpayer's income for a recurring benefit or
adjudication of an employee's clearance), organizations incorporate
mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures and
methods to validate the PII is accurate, relevant, timely, and complete.
