media sanitization and disposal; media sanitization records, audit records, and
other relevant documents or records.Interview: Organizational personnel with
information system media sanitization responsibilities.

  desc  'fix', "
    Implementation Standards:

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Organizations review and approve media to be sanitized to ensure compliance
with records-retention policies. Tracking/documenting actions include, for
example, listing personnel who reviewed and approved sanitization and disposal
actions, types of media sanitized, specific files stored on the media,
sanitization methods used, date and time of the sanitization actions, personnel
who performed the sanitization, verification actions taken, personnel who
performed the verification, and disposal action taken. Organizations verify
that the sanitization of the media was effective prior to disposal.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Tracking, documenting, and verifying media sanitization and disposal
actions for media that contains sensitive information, such as personally
identifiable information (PII), reduces the risk of unauthorized disclosure of
sensitive information and increases accountability.
