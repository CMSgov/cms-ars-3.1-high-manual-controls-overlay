    High, Moderate & Low:

    CSP.1 - For CSPs, the organization reviews the content on the publicly
accessible organizational information system for nonpublic information at least
quarterly.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies,
regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the public is not authorized access to
nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and
proprietary information). This control addresses information systems that are
controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without
identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-CMS
information systems is covered by organizational policy.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    A system of records maintaining personally identifiable information (PII)
that is not approved for release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is
nonpublic information. When agencies consider sharing or posting PII, they must
do so in a way that fully protects individual privacy. Under HIPAA, a covered
entity or business associate may not use or disclose protected health
information except as provided by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This control
implements procedures to protect information, including PII, from being posted
publicly improperly.PII that is nonpublic information must not be posted onto a
publicly accessible information system.
