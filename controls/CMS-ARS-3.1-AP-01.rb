    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    An organization identifies the legal authority permitting collection.
Additional measures, including design choices, ensure the information system
collecting, using, maintaining, or disseminating PII complies with those
authorities permitting the collection.Before collecting PII, the organization
determines whether the contemplated collection of PII is legally authorized.
Program officials consult with the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP), and legal
counsel regarding the authority of any program or activity to collect PII. The
authority to collect PII is documented in the System of Records Notice (SORN),
Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA), and/or other applicable documentation such as
Privacy Act Statements, Notices of Privacy Practices, Website Privacy Policies,
or Computer Matching Agreements.Ensure PII collected, used, maintained, or
disseminated by the information system is related to, and compatible with, the
purpose and scope of the authority described in the information system
documentation, including privacy documentation such as a SORN or PIA when
applicable.
