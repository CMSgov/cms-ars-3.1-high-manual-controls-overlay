control 'CMS-ARS-3.1-AC-19(05)' do
  title 'Full Device/Container-Based Encryption '
  desc  "Control:
    The organization employs CMS-required (FIPS 140-2 validated module)
full-device encryption or container encryption to protect the confidentiality
and integrity of information on approved mobile devices.
  "
  desc  'check', "
    Assessment Objective:
    Determine if the organization has implemented all elements of this control
as described in the control statements and implementation standard(s).

    Assessment Methods and Objects:
    Examine: Access control policy; system security plan; procedures addressing
access control for mobile devices; information system design documentation;
information system configuration settings and associated documentation;
information system audit records; and other relevant documents or
records.Examine: Mobile device systems implement CMS required (FIPS 140-2
validated module) functionality that provides full disk encryption or container
encryption.Test: Mechanisms implementing encryption control policy for mobile
devices.Full disk/device encryption applications must be configured to meet CMS
requirements (FIPS 140-2 validated module).
  "
  desc  'fix', "
    Implementation Standards:
    Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    High & Moderate:

    PRIV.1 - Encrypt information on all mobile devices that contain low,
moderate, and high PII confidentiality impact level information.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the
encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including, for example,
encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. FIPS
140-2 approved security function families are found at  HYPERLINK
\"http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/validation.html\" . However,
implementing an approved security function is the start. The product must also
be on the approved validation lists. (See  HYPERLINK
\"http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm\"  for a
list of current validated products.)

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Since mobile devices are more likely to be lost or stolen, sensitive
information on a mobile device is more vulnerable. Encryption reduces this
vulnerability.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation
specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at
45 C.F.R. ยง 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d)
(Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the
organization.
