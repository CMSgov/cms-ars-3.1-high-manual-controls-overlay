    Supplemental Guidance:
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Access to sensitive information, such as personally identifiable
information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), requires both a valid
need to know as documented by an access authorization request, and requires a
background investigation (or appropriate screening) to ensure the individual
being provided access is suitable.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation
specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at
45 C.F.R. ยง 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d)
(Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the
organization.
