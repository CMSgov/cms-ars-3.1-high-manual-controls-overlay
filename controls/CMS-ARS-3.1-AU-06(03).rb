    Implementation Standards:
    High & Moderate:

    Std.1 - Correlated results from automated tools must be searchable by the
CCIC: (a) Information is provided to the CCIC in a format compliant with CMS
and Federal (e.g., Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation) requirements; (b)
Repository sources include systems, appliances, devices, services, and
applications (including databases); and (c) CCIC directed repository
information collection rules/requests (e.g., sources, queries, data calls) must
be implemented/provided within the timeframe specified in the request.Std.2 -
As required by CMS, raw audit records must be available in an unaltered format
to the CCIC.Std.3 - Raw security information/results from relevant automated
tools must be available in an unaltered format to the CCIC.

    Supplemental Guidance:
    Organization-wide situational awareness includes awareness across all three
tiers of risk management (i.e., organizational, mission/business process, and
information system) and supports cross-organization awareness. Contact your CRA
or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and
results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available
to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a
format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent
with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include
PHI):

    Correlating and analyzing privacy audit logs across different log
repositories and systems provides greater awareness of privacy incidents and
breaches across the organization.
